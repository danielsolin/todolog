# Todolog

Todolog is a simple and web application for managing your daily tasks. It
combines a standard todo list with a persistent log of your completed items,
helping you track your productivity over time.

It is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and uses the browser's
`localStorage` for all data storage, meaning it runs entirely on the client-
side with no server needed.
