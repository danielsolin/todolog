# Todolog

Todolog is a simple and web application for managing your daily tasks. It
combines a standard todo list with a persistent log of your completed items,
helping you track your productivity over time.

It is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and uses the browser's
`localStorage` for all data storage, meaning it runs entirely on the client-
side with no server needed.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
*   **Storage:** Browser `localStorage`

## Getting Started

To run this application, you need to serve the files from a local web server. This is required for the Progressive Web App (PWA) features to work correctly.

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the following command (requires Node.js and npx):
    ```shell
    npx serve
    ```
4.  Open the URL provided by the server (usually `http://localhost:3000`) in a modern browser like Chrome.
