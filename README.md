# Todolog

Todolog is a simple and clean web application for managing your daily tasks. It combines a standard todo list with a persistent log of your completed items, helping you track your productivity over time.

This project is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and uses the browser's `localStorage` for all data storage, meaning it runs entirely on the client-side with no server needed.

## Features

*   **Add Todos:** Quickly add new tasks to your list.
*   **View Open Todos:** See a clear list of all tasks that still need to be completed.
*   **Complete Tasks:** Mark tasks as done with a single click.
*   **Completion Log:** View a history of all your completed tasks, automatically grouped by the date of completion.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
*   **Storage:** Browser `localStorage`
